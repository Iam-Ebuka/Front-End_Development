        <header><h2>HTML</h2></header>
        <p>HTML means Hypertext Markup Language. It is the official language for writting webpages. Html was created in the late 20th century and it has since then evolved in its nature.</p>
        <p>There are different versions of HTML. Today we are using HTML5 version which has been made to be more effective. Today, most browsers have met up with the trend as they are now supporting HTML5. What makes a document recognised as a HTML5 document is shown below:</P>
        <code><&#33;DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>

      <section class="main-section" id="html_a_programming_language?">
        <header><h2>HTML a Programming Language?</header>
        <p>This is a question that has come up several times in different forums. Before we can answer this question, We have to define what a programming language is.</p>
        <p>A programming language is a set of instructions which tells the computer what to do. HTML is not regarded as a programming language because it doesn't tell the computer to carry out tasks. HTML only gives a webpage a structure.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;header&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;main&gt;...&lt;/main&gt;</code></pre>

      <section class="main-section" id="css">
        <header><h2>CSS</h2></header>
        <p>CSS means Cascading Style Sheet. It is used for giving webpages a design. CSS works hand in hand with the HTML.</p>
        <p>It picks a HTML element and adds style to it.</p>
        <code>body {font-size: 20px;
          color: white;}</code>
          <code>* {box-sizing: border-box;}</code>

        <header><h2>CSS a Programming Language?</h2></header>
        <p>CSS is not a programming language because it doesn't instruct the computer with tasks to accomplish</p>
        <p>There are also different versions of CSS with CSS3 being the latest</p>
